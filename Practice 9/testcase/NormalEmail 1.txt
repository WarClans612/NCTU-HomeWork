Please contact with ALi company to make sure their sales will 
go to our lab to check 
if their new products (machines) can bundle with our distributed system tomorrow. 

They say their new machines get the first prize from international platform contest 
and also send an award 
news to me as an attachment. You have to confirm their machine 
is compatible with our system since their 
support team of this company are very famous 
and senior and the payment to supporting fee is very expensive. 
Chat with sales to know 
more details of their product; or you have to link to their web site of https://ALi.com 

to review their spec and values. Also check if they have any discount plan recently.
