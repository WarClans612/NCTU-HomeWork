# ML Assignment2 

## K-means
* `kmeans.py` is pure kmeans code.
* `kmeans_xy.ipynb` is kmeans by `x` & `y`, with k<=6
* `kmeans_xy_3.ipynb` is kmeans by `x` & `y`, with k=3.
    we calculate **accuracy** here.
* `kmeans_ss.ipynb` is kmeans by `speed` & `spin`, with k=3.

## KD-Tree
* `kdtree/kd.py` is the source code of our kdtree.
* `kdtree/kd.ipynb` shows the visualized results.
