# ML Assignment3 

## Problem1
* single-var LR with built-in function
  * The code, graph, accuracy, weight and bias for problem 1 

## Problem2
* single-var LR with own gradient descent
  * The code, graph, accuracy, weight and bias for problem 2 

## Problem3
* **multi**-var LR with own gradient descent
  * The code, MSE, R2, and the accuracy for problem 3
  
## Problem3_wj
* **multi**-var LR with own gradient descent
  * Using individual wj to be updated in each iteration, rather than **w** vector

## Problem4
* Polynomial Regression with own gradient descent
  * The code, MSE, R2, and the accuracy for problem 4
  
## Bonus
* Making different regression model to make the accuracy > 0.87
Hint: You can also change your loss function
